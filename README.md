[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/nasa/isaac_user_interface)](https://github.com/nasa/isaac_user_interface/blob/master/LICENSE)

### The NASA ISAAC UI is a full-fledged web-based user interface system for ROS projects. It provides a pre-configured frontend, backend, and database that allow monitoring and control of robots built using ROS.

## Quick Start

   Clone the ISAAC UI repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/nasa/isaac_user_interface.git`

   Build the ISAAC UI:

   `./build.sh`

   Run the ISAAC UI:

   `./run.sh`

   Check the status of the ISAAC UI:

   `./status.sh`

   Shutdown the ISAAC UI:

   `./shutdown.sh`

---

## Prerequisites

To build and run the ISAAC UI you must have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation) or [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)

You might already have the prerequisites installed. Verify this:

```bash
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   rosversion ros
```

Clone the ISAAC UI repository locally:

```
   git clone https://github.com/nasa/isaac_user_interface.git
   cd isaac_user_interface
```

The ISAAC UI assumes you have a ROS master node, but will run a master node for you should that not be the case.

```bash
   ./build.sh  # this may take 5 - 10 minutes

   ./run.sh  # now the UI is running at http://localhost:8080

   ./status.sh  # check the status of each subsystem

   ./shutdown.sh  # shutdown the UI 
```

## Usage with ISAAC

This user interface was built to support the Integrated System for Autonomous and Adaptive Caretaking (ISAAC) project, which is available [here](https://github.com/nasa/isaac). Installation instructions for the ISAAC simulation are available [here](https://github.com/nasa/isaac/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Once the simulation has been built, the easiest way to launch the ISAAC UI linked to the ISAAC simulation is by following the steps below.

```bash
# move to the ISAAC workspace defined in the installation steps
cd $ISAAC_WS

# clone this repository inside the workspace directory
git clone https://github.com/nasa/isaac_user_interface.git

# source the ISAAC simulation setup.bash file
source ./devel/setup.bash

# unset $ROS_MASTER_URI so ISAAC UI launches its own ROS Master node
unset ROS_MASTER_URI

# enter the ISAAC UI repository root directory
cd isaac_user_interface

# build and run the ISAAC UI
./build.sh && ./run.sh

# start ISAAC simulation and connect to ROS Master node
roslaunch isaac sim.launch --wait

# the ISAAC UI is now available at http://localhost:8080
```

## Debugging

If you get a permissions error when running a Docker script, you can either:

1. Run the scripts (.sh files) as root (preprend sudo to each command); OR
2. Add your linux user to the docker user group:

```
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   newgrp docker
```
